is my first bigger Project for learning purposes. 
It is also a Project i wanted to do for a long time.

It's a Browsergame where you play as a Captain, of a not completed bigger Spaceship.
It is not completed, because you had to rapidly leave the Station, where your were stationed with your fellow Crewmembers. Because of an attack from an unknown Fraktion.

Your Mission is now, to complete your Spaceship and build your own Spacestation. 
Build the needed Spaceships, farm Asteroids and sell the Minerals and Metalls at the Market.
