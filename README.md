# projektCiara

is my first bigger Project for learning purposes. 
It is also a Project i wanted to do for a long time.

For more infos on what i am currently Working on and whats coming next 
Please see the Wiki on github

It's a Browsergame where you play as a Captain, of a not completed bigger Spaceship.
It is not completed, because you had to rapidly leave the Station, where your were stationed with your fellow Crewmembers. Because of an attack from an unknown Fraktion.

Your Mission is now, to complete your Spaceship and build your own Spacestation. 
Build the needed Spaceships, farm Asteroids and sell the Minerals and Metalls at the market 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I highly recommend to open it in VsCode and start it with the "live Server extension" because its super easy

click on explore and there you are, your spacestation!
From here you can build units, upgrade your Hangar farm asteroids to get some Ressources.
You can sell the Ressources at the market to get your first credits.

From there you can upgrade your Modules and get more units to farm more asteroids.
